# Semantic-Features
Semantic Features for Localisation
# Tasks old:
Only use static classes for coco <br>
Find datasets with static features for training (all) <br>
representation? point based? <br>
Diff.GPS Data into map representation (Johannes) <br>
Geometric localization tool/representation

# Tasks new:
Johannes: Improve mapping - Heading angle and object classes
Julius: Check if easier way to detect signs etc. and train detector on cityscapes 
Felix: Kitti dataset(for better GPS groundtruth) and helps Juuu and thinks about feature mapping
Berk: Improve code and check if return values are true
